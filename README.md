# WumpusWorld-Java
This was a paired programming assignment where we had to create an AI for the game WumpusWorld. My partner and I decided to write our implementation of the the AI in python. From here, we implemented pathfinding through a modified version of depth-first-searching, as well as keeping track of game-state data, in order for our AI to make the safest and most cost-effective decisions. In a class-wide tournament, our AI ended up performing in the top 90 percentile.

# Requirements
<ul>
  <li>Any standard Java compiler</li>
 </ul>
 
 # To Run
 <ul>
  <li> First compile the AI by executing the <em>make</em> command in the root directory of Wumpus_World_Java_Shell folder. </li>
  <li> Then, from the <em>bin/</em> folder within the Wumpus_World_Java_Shell folder, execute <em>java ‒ jar Wumpus_World.jar</em>
    <ul>
      <li>For a step-by-step view, run <em>java ‒ jar Wumpus_World.jar -d</em>, which displays the game board after every move</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
